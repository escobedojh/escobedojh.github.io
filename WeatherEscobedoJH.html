 <h1>Initial Planning Document </h1>
 <a href="https://escobedojh.github.io">Main Page</a>
<h2>Purpose Statement: </h2>
<p>This will be a  weather information webpage that will focus on three cities. It will give the weather either in Celsius or Fahrenheit and will be based on reliable information that will be continuously updated.</p>

<h2>Audience Description: </h2>
<p>For my weather page everyone is invited to come and trust in our services 
but I think the most common ages will be between 17-45 years old, people who need to know what to wear and do in a typical day. 
I want to keep it with a simple design but still classy. By combining a nice and clean design where the first thing you notice is the current weather in a center box. 
In the edges there will be information of social media and a browse bar. </p>

<h2> Persona: </h2>
<p>I will concentrate in a young target where they want to just know the weather and know what to wear and do that day and the day after. 
They don’t want annoying ads or boring text. 
Images will be crucial and have expectations that our information can be trusted.</p>

<h2>Sketches (wireframes)</h2>

<h2> Peer Review </h2>
<p>(Everyday my last class is at 1:45 and I work all afternoons after school so I did my peer review with classmates from my COMM 310 Class)</p>

<p>Austin Smith: "Try it to be more visual appealing by using something more than the old white background,
 use the color scheme to know what color patters you can combine and be more suitable to your weather page if you want to keep it simple but classy”</p>

<p>Estefany Catillo: “I like the concept and idea that you want to use images but keep in mind they need to be of good definition and that some text is also necessary.
 Also keep the alignment clear and easy yo understand"</p>
